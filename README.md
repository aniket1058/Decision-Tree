Decision Tree Implementation README

This repository contains Python code for implementing decision trees, a powerful machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. Decision trees are intuitive, easy to interpret, and capable of handling both numerical and categorical data. This implementation focuses on creating decision trees from scratch using basic Python libraries.
